# Airbnb-Booking-EDA-Analysis
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Airbnb listing data to uncover meaningful insights about rental patterns, pricing strategies, and host behavior. By analyzing data from the Inside Airbnb platform, we explore how different factors like location, room type, and availability influence listing prices and customer preferences.
