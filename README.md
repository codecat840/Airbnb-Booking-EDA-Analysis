# Airbnb-Booking-EDA-Analysis
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Airbnb listing data to uncover meaningful insights about rental patterns, pricing strategies, and host behavior. By analyzing data from the Inside Airbnb platform, we explore how different factors like location, room type, and availability influence listing prices and customer preferences.  The project uses data visualization and statistical techniques to provide a comprehensive understanding of the Airbnb marketplace in a selected city.


## 📊 Project Overview

The Airbnb dataset contains information about various listings including location, price, number of reviews, availability, and more. Through this project, we aim to:

- Understand data structure and clean it for analysis
- Analyze distributions of numerical and categorical variables
- Identify factors affecting price and availability
- Detect outliers and missing data
- Visualize key trends using interactive plots
